## ✅ Hints / Mini Guide for Effective Dashboarding

To maintain clarity, professionalism, and actionable insights, follow these key design principles:

1. **Choose the right chart for the data** – Use line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, and pie charts sparingly.
2. **Avoid clutter and overuse of colors** – Stick to a clean layout and consistent color palette.
3. **Highlight key takeaways** – Use data labels, conditional formatting, and titles to guide viewers.
4. **Add context to each chart** – Always include axis titles, legends, and tooltips to make data clear.
5. **Focus on business insights, not just visuals** – Interpret what the data means and why it matters.
6. **Create a summary slide/storyboard** – Summarize key findings with high-level overviews for executives or stakeholders.
